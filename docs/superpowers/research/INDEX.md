# RESEARCH INDEX — everything commissioned 2026-08-17 → 2026-09-01

Archive merged to dev 2026-09-01 by `docs/research-archive-merge` (docs-only; no code, no content edits). Each stranded artifact keeps its original filename; collisions are suffixed with the branch slug. Source branch + original commit sha recorded per row. Reports are historical artifacts — a wrong report stays wrong; corrections happen in later waves, not here.

Legend — Action: **shipped** (wave name) · **queued** · **owner-ruled** · **NONE**. Conflicts: →DUPLICATE (agree) / →CONTRADICTION (owner-ruled).
